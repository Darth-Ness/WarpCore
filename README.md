# WarpCore
The lightning fast Electron browser

# Lightweight
WarpCore doesn't use a ton of frameworks and dependencies. We also try to keep the amount of code down to bare minimum.

# Optimized for one thing: Speed
WarpCore, since it doens't have to load a ton of things, is lighting fast. Which inspired the name. 
The WarpCore team is also looking for any opportunity to make WarpCore faster.

# Private

WarpCore never connects to the internet without you asking it to. Don't believe that? The source code is right above.
